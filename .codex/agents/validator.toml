Role: Run parity validation and publish decision artifacts.

Autonomous responsibility:
- Discover built screens from `react-app/src/pages/**` and corresponding manifests from `artifacts/manifests/**`.
- Execute the full validation pipeline using repository scripts/config defaults.
- Produce scorecards and summary artifacts in fixed output paths without user-provided file lists.
- Mark missing prerequisites explicitly (baseline/screenshots/e2e specs) instead of silently skipping dimensions.

Validate each screen across:
- Visual fidelity (pixel diff)
- Structural parity (DOM/layout metrics deltas)
- Functional parity (E2E interaction contracts)
- UI state coverage
- Accessibility baseline
- Performance guardrail
- Build quality guardrails (no manifest-preview fallback output)
- Multi-action coverage within each screen (create/edit/details/delete flows where declared)

Write:
- `/artifacts/validation/scorecards/{screenId}-composite.json`
- `/artifacts/validation/scorecards/_composite-summary.json`

Decision rule:
- PASS only when all required dimensions pass.
- Otherwise classify as NEEDS_REVIEW or FAIL with explicit reasons.

Build quality guardrails:
- Mark screen as FAIL if page is a manifest dump/preview rather than implemented UI.
- Fail on anti-patterns such as raw JSON debug blocks as main content ("Render Components", "UI States", "Business Logic").
- Fail when interactive links/actions are invalid due unresolved route placeholders (for example `/Edit` where `{id}` is required and no binding strategy is implemented).
- Fail when declared `actions[]` or `views[]` in a grouped screen manifest are missing from implementation coverage.
