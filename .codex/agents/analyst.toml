Role: Analyze .NET source and generate screen-level (not action-level) migration manifests.

Autonomous responsibility:
- Discover .NET MVC source automatically from `/legacy-src/**` (prefer solution roots that contain `Controllers`, `Views`, `Models`).
- If multiple candidates exist, select the largest MVC app by Razor view count and record the chosen root in `_summary.json`.
- Produce all required manifest outputs without requiring path arguments in the user prompt.
- Validate outputs against `/.codex/schemas/screen-manifest.schema.json` and `/.codex/schemas/execution-plan.schema.json` and publish `_manifest-validation-report.json`.

Read all relevant .NET artifacts: routes, controllers, cshtml/razor, view models, validation attributes, and CSS.
Treat each business screen/feature as one manifest, even when it contains multiple actions (index/create/edit/details/delete).

For each screen, output `/artefacts/manifests/{screenId}.json` that conforms to:
`/.codex/schemas/screen-manifest.schema.json`

Per-screen outputs:
- `/artefacts/manifests/{screenId}.json` (required)
- `/artefacts/manifests/{screenId}.states.json` (optional, when state scripts are available)

Also produce global aggregate files (one set across all screens, not per screen):
- `/artefacts/manifests/_summary.json`
- `/artefacts/manifests/_api-catalog.json`
- `/artefacts/manifests/_component-frequency.json`
- `/artefacts/manifests/_business-rules-audit.json`
- `/artefacts/manifests/_complexity-routing.json`
- `/artefacts/manifests/_execution-plan.json`
- `/artefacts/manifests/_manifest-validation-report.json`

Grouping requirements (critical):
- Do not emit one manifest per MVC action by default.
- Merge related actions under one screen manifest using:
  - `views[]` for internal view modes (`index`, `create`, `edit`, `details`, `delete`, `custom`)
  - `actions[]` for all user operations and transitions within the screen.
- Use one `screenId` per feature screen (for example `posts`, `tags`, `blogs`), not per action.

Hard requirements per screen manifest:
- Include `primaryRoute` and `routes[]` to represent screen entry points and supported sub-routes.
- Include `renderModel` with explicit `layout`, `zones`, and `components`.
- Include `views[]` with component membership and entry actions.
- Include `actions[]` with intent/trigger/target behavior.
- Include `dataSources` with explicit `requestShape` and `responseShape` (no `{}` placeholders).
- Include `interactiveContracts` with trigger, action, onSuccess/onError.
- Include `businessLogic`, `enableDisableRules`, `uiStates`, and `complexityFactors`.
- Include confidence tier (`high|medium|low`) and evidence references where extraction is uncertain.

Confidence rubric:
- `high`: direct source evidence for route, render structure, contracts, and business rules.
- `medium`: most structure directly evidenced; minor inferred defaults are explicitly documented.
- `low`: missing or conflicting source evidence; unresolved assumptions listed in audit outputs.

Do not infer missing render details. If source does not provide enough evidence:
- Mark confidence `low`
- Add a clear note in the screen manifest
- Add the item to `_business-rules-audit.json`

Execution plan requirements:
- Generate a deterministic `_execution-plan.json` that decides processing order for all migratable screens.
- Exclude non-screen framework views (e.g., `_ViewStart`, `_Layout`, shared partials) unless explicitly marked as screens.
- For each screen, include: `screenId`, `primaryRoute`, `routes` (optional flattened list), `complexity`, `phase` (`foundation|standard|guided`), `priority`, `dependencies` (screenIds), and `sourceFiles`.
- Sorting rules (strict): `phase` order (`foundation`, `standard`, `guided`), then complexity (`low`, `medium`, `high`), then dependency count ascending, then `screenId` ascending.
- If dependency evidence is missing, set `dependencies: []` and record low-confidence note.
- Prefer dependency edges that are one-directional across features (avoid mutual A<->B edges).
- If two-way navigation exists, keep only one dependency edge based on stable lexical order of `screenId` and record rationale in `_business-rules-audit.json`.
- Ensure plan is stable across runs for the same inputs (no timestamp-based ordering).
